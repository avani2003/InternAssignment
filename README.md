# InternAssignment
Web Development Intern Assignment


You need to **clone this project** and set it up on a **repository on your own GitHub account**. (Must be a public repository)
You will modify the code in this project to complete the given tasks and push the changes to your respective repository.
You will **submit a link to this repository**, before the deadline, on completion of your work **via email.** (to the email id as shared earlier)

You may setup deployment of your code on this repository through GitHub but, in this case, you must mention the instructions for the same in your respository's README.md file. This is completely optional and will not affect your application for this role.

**You may add any instructions, that you feel may be necessary, in the README.md file of your repository.**

**As long as you do not copy any code, design or concept from anywhere, you are free to use the Internet to guide you.**

We will use React JS for the Front-End in this project and module.scss files to style the pages.
A basic react and styles page has been already created for your understanding.

If not done already, you will need to setup **node and npm or yarn** on your system to be able to run this project.
After doing this, to run the project, open a Terminal or Command Prompt in the folder InternAssignment/sand-and-sea and run:
  1. **npm install**
  2. **npm start** / **yarn start**

**Sand & Sea Yoga and Wellness Retreat**

Sand & Sea is a Pune based company which organizes yoga and wellness retreats across the country.
They host 2 retreats every month at different locations by tying up with local hotels and resorts.
They hire yoga and meditation experts to conduct activities for the retreat participants along with offering healthy foods. (in collaboration with the resorts)

**Task 1**

Create a Header and a Footer for the Website.
You may design it as per your understanding of the requirements for this business.

**Task 2**

You will design a Home Page for Sand & Sea Yoga and Wellness Retreat in home.js.
It must contain:
  1. A slider page at the top displaying the trending activities of the Website. (You may use images from the Internet, if needed)
  2. Upcoming retreats and booking information.

**Task 3 (Bonus Task: Optional and Only Considered after judging your work on other tasks)**

Find an online api for yoga / fitness related activities and perform a GET api call, from home.js, to fetch a list of these activities and display them on our Home Page.

Remember that your coding style, code maintainability and code reuse skills play an important role.

Suggestions:
  1. Use Camel Casing as the Naming Convention.
  2. Reuse and Modularize code as much as possible. (Do not overdo it either)
  3. Maintain code legibility by proper indentation, commenting where required and having a max word count per line. (Unlike this :P)

**The deadline for this assigment is Saturday 10th April 2021 End of the Day.**

Good Luck! Happy Coding!
